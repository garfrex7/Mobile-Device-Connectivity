# Mobile-Device-Connectivity
Professer Messer's video about Mobile Device Connectivivty


One way a Mobile Device can be paired to something is Bluetooth, and you only have to pair it one time. And I will give instructions to a generic Bluetooth device. The first thing you need to do is turn on Bluetooth on your phone, and then after that, on the device you want to pair, there is usually a button that, when you hold it, then it shows up on the unpaired devices category. Then you can click on the device you have, but sometimes it’s not like that, so you have to read the manual to figure it out. And sometimes you have to put a pin in, and it probably comes with the thing, but most of the time you don’t have to put the pin in.

Phones also connect to GPS, and that’s short for Global Positioning System. It was originally made by the US Department of Defense, and there are over 30 satellites currently in orbit. But you need to be able to have 4 satellites to see where you are precisely, and our phones are able to figure out what time it is wherever you are from the different time differences from different satellites. And cell towers are also used, and WIFI, and big organizations use MDM, and that stands for Mobile Device Management. And that lets the like boss person manage everyone’s phones—like they can update everyone’s phones or disable apps. They can also do it for Emails.
